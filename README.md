# Pitwall---Formula-1-Data Scraping & Analysis Project

This project collects, cleans, and analyzes historical and performance-related data from a Formula 1 database using web scraping techniques and Python-based data workflows. Data is extracted from Pitwall-f1 database, a publicly accessible website that compiles detailed records for drivers, teams, and seasons.

The goal is to:
- Automate data extraction using Selenium and BeautifulSoup
- Structure the data using pandas for analysis and visualization
- Explore trends such as podium efficiency, race count evolution, and seasonal patterns
